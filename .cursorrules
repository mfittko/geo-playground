# geo-playground CLI guidelines

## Code
- Follow KISS, DRY, SRP principles
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Keep files small and structured
- Update all translation files when changing text or adding new translations

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - start dev server
- `npm run lint` - check code quality
- `npm run build` - production build
- `npm run build:dev` - development build

## Git
- Make atomic commits with prefixes: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Group related changes logically
- NEVER ADD/COMMIT ANY WIP OR REDUNDANT COMMENTS! They have to be removed before.

## Components
- Use Shadcn UI components
- Follow project structure
- Ensure accessibility

## State
- React context for global state
- React Query for server state
- Local state when possible

## Testing
- Jest for unit tests: `npm run test`
- Playwright for e2e tests: `npm run e2e:ci`
- e2e: The server will always be running on the default port. No reason to start it.
- e2e: Make sure not to add timeouts (use waiting selectors instead) or increase overall timeouts!
- React Testing Library for components
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Use pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Run relevant tests after changes
- Run tests in headless mode and check output (and screenshots in test-results for e2e)

## Performance/Security
- Memoize complex calculations
- Lazy load when appropriate
- Validate inputs, sanitize output
- Don't expose sensitive data client-side
- Avoid attaching event handlers excessively
