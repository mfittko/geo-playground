# Cursor Rules for geo-playground

## General Coding Guidelines
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Keep files small and structured
- Add unit tests for all significant functional changes
- Ensure code is properly typed with TypeScript

## Translation Management
- When adding or modifying user-facing text, update all translation files in src/locales (en.json, es.json, fr.json, de.json)
- Use the translation keys consistently across the application
- Run translation validation after updating translation files

## Commands to Use
- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Use `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
- Use `npm run build` to create a production build
- Use `npm run build:dev` to create a development build

## Git Workflow
- Make atomic commits with clear commit messages
- Group related changes in logical commits
- Prefix commit messages with the type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)

## Component Guidelines
- Use Shadcn UI components when available
- Follow the established project structure for new components
- Ensure components are responsive and accessible

## State Management
- Use React context for global state
- Use React Query for server state management
- Prefer local component state when possible

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize expensive operations
- Use memoization for complex calculations
- Lazy load components and routes when appropriate

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Don't expose sensitive information in client-side code
