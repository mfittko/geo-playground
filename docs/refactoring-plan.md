# Refactoring Plan for Geo-Playground

## Overview

After analyzing the codebase, we've identified several areas that could benefit from refactoring to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability. This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the Geo-Playground application. Whenever a point in this document is finished, we will not forget to check it off.

## Current Architecture

The application follows a React-based architecture with the following key components:

1. **App.tsx**: Main application component that sets up routing and providers
2. **Index.tsx**: Main page component that orchestrates the geometry canvas and related components
3. **useShapeOperations.ts**: Custom hook that manages shape state and operations
4. **GeometryCanvas**: Component that renders the canvas and handles user interactions
5. **Utility modules**: Various utility functions for shape creation, manipulation, and measurements

## Identified Issues

1. **Large component files**: Some components like GeometryCanvas are very large (1000+ lines) and handle too many responsibilities
2. **Complex event handling**: Canvas event handling is complex and spread across multiple files
3. **Lack of unit tests**: No unit tests exist for critical utility functions
4. **Tight coupling**: Components are tightly coupled, making it difficult to test and maintain
5. **Duplicated logic**: Some logic is duplicated across different files
6. **Complex state management**: State management is complex and spread across multiple components

## Refactoring Target: Shape Operations Utilities

For this refactoring effort, we'll focus on the shape operations utilities, specifically:

- `src/utils/geometry/shapeOperations.ts`
- `src/utils/geometry/shapeCreation.ts`
- `src/utils/geometry/shapeUpdates.ts`

These utilities are critical to the application's functionality and would benefit from improved organization and test coverage.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Improve organization**: Reorganize the shape utilities into a more cohesive structure
2. **Add unit tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for shape operations
3. **Reduce complexity**: Break down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions
4. **Improve type safety**: Enhance TypeScript types to catch more errors at compile time
5. **Improve documentation**: Add better documentation to functions and modules
